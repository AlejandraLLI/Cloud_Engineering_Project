- Define transformations 
- Add date and augment data?
- Review architecture draft

### Tasks for next week


## Meeting: April 13th, 2023

### Discussion

Asteriod

	- Pros: 
		- intersting problem, well defined, applicable
		- "simple" data set
		- Sample notebooks for inspiration
		- 31 features, ?? rows.

	- Cons: 
		- Difficult problem to solve, high knowledge to understand. 
		- "Fancy API" would be more difficult to achieve

	- Problem: predict asteriod diameter


Driving Behavior 

	- Pros: 
		- well defined, applicable
		- many notebooks 

	- Cons: 
		- Few columns (8)
		- 2000 rows

	- Problem: 
		- classify driving (slow, normal, agressive) by using smartphone data from sensors 


Flight Prices: 
	- Pros:
		- Eassy problem, well defined 
		- Could build a nice API
		-  rows, 12 features

	- Cons:
		- Too many categoricals, but can use only Random Forest

	- Problem: 
		- Predict fight prices. 


- We decided to use flight prices problem. Asteriods is the back up project. 
- Business problem: predict ticket price 
- Discuss the two datasets with Ashish. He said the flight prices problem is ok. Although he taught we had a time series in the begining. 

### Tasks for next week

- Draft of cloud architecture
- Start code for tasks in weeks 4 & 5 of his timeline: data ingestion and data cleaning
